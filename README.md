# IBM-Capstone-Cognos

**The Scenario** - To keep pace changes in technologies, it is required to perform regular analysis of the 
developer ecosystem to identify current/future skill requirements. 
Proposed Solution - By collecting and analysing wrangled datasets from sources including; Job postings, 
Training portals and Surveys obtained through API endpoints and web scraping. This will allow for 
greater understanding of the most in demand skill sets for programmers this would facilitate impactful 
insights by answer the following: 
**• What are the top programming languages in demand?**

**• What are the top database skills in demand?**

**• What are the key demographics of developers?**

**Processes** - Through data collecting and wrangling, exploratory data analysis and visualisation was 
possible using statistical and explorative data practices including data normalisation, outlier detection, 
aggregation and visualisation to help provide impactful and actionable insights into the future skills 
development of Technologists within different disciplines. 
**The opportunities** - This insight can help guide resource allocation, training initiatives, and hiring 
strategies to stay competitive in the rapidly evolving IT landscape. Further resulting in organisations 
being able to identify areas of growth and investment to stay ahead of the curve in a rapidly evolving 
tech industry.

Linked below is a Dashboard created using IBM Cognos to draw insight into how Developers who work with programming, database and web frame technologies, with a focus on both current technologies and technologies that developers desire to learn the follwoing year:
